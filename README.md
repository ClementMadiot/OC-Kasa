- **React** is a javaScript library for building user interfaces (UIs). Uses a component-based approach where complex UIs are built from smaller, reusable components. Focuses on the view layer (what the user sees) of a web application.

- **Node.js** is a runtime environment that allows you to execute JavaScript code server-side. It's built on Chrome's V8 JavaScript engine and is widely used for building scalable network applications, APIs, and servers.

- **React-router** is a routing library for React applications that Manages navigation between different views (pages) within the application. Helps keep track of the URL and displays the corresponding component based on the route.

- **Sass** is a preprocessor for CSS that adds features like variables, nesting, mixins, and functions.

- **Styled-component** is a library for styling React components that allows to write CSS directly within your React components using template literals.
